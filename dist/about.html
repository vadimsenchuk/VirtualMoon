                            The Moon will play a central role in the evolution of the Human species into a Spacefaring Civilization. The Moon will not only become a place to develop and perfect critical space technologies, it will be a premier destination for millions who wish to experience the ultimate lifetime adventure.   Within the next generation, ever larger large scale permanent towns and cities will be built on the Moon.

                            As the price of a visit the Moon drops over time, it will eventually become affordable to mainstream consumers and accessible to the average person. Virtual Moon will be the ultimate expression of that Vision. Virtual Moon will be a glimpse into the kind of Future we can build.  A main feature and destination on Virtual Moon will be Selene - a large scale permanent resort city built on Malapert Moutain. Selene will be a bold and inspiring vision of what is possible within our lifetime.

Within one year of opening Virtual Moon to the public, our goal is to virtually transport ONE MILLION people to the Moon. Virtual Moon will be open and free for everyone to explore and to enjoy! You are all invited to experience being on the Moon in the most accurate, detailed, and realistic immersive simulation ever created.  We want to capture the imagination young people from 7 to 77 years old of new generations of children and young adults to the realization that they can actively participate in creating that Future.

                                Many of our Virtual Moon team share a similar memory of how our passion for the Moon was ignited. We were all witnesses to history being made as Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the Lunar surface. My own personal memory of the event — an event which I have come to regard as the single greatest moment in all of human history so far - is of being excited at the thought of a future where anyone could one day go visit the Moon and I certainly wanted to be among those. As a ten-year-old year old in July of 1969, I figured that in another 3 of my lifetimes, somewhere around the year 2000, that future that I was imagining would have become a reality.  By the year 2000, I thought, I would be able to stand on the surface of the Moon and look back at Earth!
                            </p>
                            <p class="text text--order2">
                                Alas, it was not to be. As the year 2000 arrived,  not only had we had failed to build the future I had dreamed of and hoped for. Worse, there was no plan in place to make it happen. America and the world had abandoned the vision. My dream of one day visiting the Moon was just never going to happen. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="text text--order2">
                                Reflecting on this I realized that I had no right to feel disappointed. After all, what had I personally done to contribute, in even the smallest measure, to making that imagined future a reality? The honest answer is that I had never lifted a finger; I had done absolutely nothing!
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                It’s not that I imagined that anything I could have done in those 30 years that elapsed since I saw the live broadcast from the Moon would have made any difference at all. It was just a feeling that there were countless things within my power that I could have done, regardless of the outcome, that I just failed to do. If you have a dream, and it’s a real and persistent dream, you have an obligation to do whatever is in your power to work towards the realization of that dream.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text">
                                I went online and looked for groups and organizations that shared my passion for the Moon.  I found an organization called the Space Frontier Foundation. Their mission statement hit home in a very profound way: “To open the Space Frontier for all of Humanity within our lifetime”. They were having a “Return To The Moon” conference in Las Vegas. I immediately signed up for a membership and registered for the Las Vegas Conference. My thinking at the time was that I would volunteer for any job or task that needed to be done. Even if it was just stuffing and mailing envelopes. No matter how menial the task might be, it would be more than doing nothing.

                                The “Return To The Moon” conference was an amazing experience! I had expected that a few thousand people would be attending. I was initially disappointed that only about a hundred people showed up. But that turned out to be the best part of it: with only a hundred people at the conference I got to meet and talk to almost everyone there. Fast forward 20 years to today: many of those people are now leaders in the private commercial efforts to build new launch systems and develop the technologies that will enable our conquest of Space.

                                As a result of my involvement and my new network of connections within the Space Advocacy community, I looked for more opportunities to contribute. I became a very active member of the Space Frontier Foundation, taking on roles of increasing responsibility. Eventually , I became Return To The Moon Project  Manager and I ended up running the Return To The Moon IV and Return To The Moon V Conferences. Our Conference Chairs and keynote speakers were Captain John Young for RTM IV and Andrew Chaikin for RTM V. One particular highlight of RTM V was the presentation of an award to Dr. George Mueller who headed the Office of Manned Space Flight at NASA. The Hero of The Moon award was presented to Dr. Mueller at the RTM Gala Dinner. The presentation included a 5 minute tribute video highlighting Dr. Mueller’s leadership of the Apollo program from 1963 to 1969.

                                Concurrently with my increased involvement and work with the SFF, I created a company called Lunar Explorer, found private investors, found a software developer and  we created the world’s first fully immersive, interactive, Virtual Reality simulation of the Moon, which is also called Lunar Explorer.

                                Lunar Explorer helped me realize my dream of one day visiting the Moon. Using the Virtual Reality mode of Lunar Explorer, I have been to every Apollo landing site, every Surveyo site and all of the Soviet Luna sites. I have walked around the surface experiments at each Apollo site, walked from the Apollo12 landing site to Surveyor 2, stood at the edge of Hadley Rille, slid down the slopes of Copernicus Crater and visited many hundreds of other locations.

                                As of late 2004, Lunar Explorer was available for sale online through a number of space websites: — (the Space Frontier Foundation, The Moon Society, the National Space Society, Space.com, as well as on Amazon).

                                By happy coincidence, even though Lunar Explorer was created over 15 years ago, it runs fairly well on any Windows 10 PC or laptop. Understandably, we are very proud of Lunar Explorer. It remains still, to this day, the world’s ONLY fully immersive, interactive, Virtual Reality simulation of the Moon.

                                Lunar Explorer was an ambitious project. However, you will remember that 15 years ago there were no consumer level Virtual Reality headsets on the market. The new VR headsets like Oculus and Vive were still a decade away. So, even though LE was a fully implemented VR experience, most users who purchased the simulation were only able to see it on their computer displays. The absence of the sense of immersion greatly diminished the impact of the user experience. In spite of this, we received universal acclaim from many users who shared their unsolicited reactions via emails.

                                    Since the advent of Oculus, Vive and other VR headsets, we have been working on a plan to create a new version of Lunar Explorer that will run on these new VR platforms. It will include all of the features of the original Lunar Explorer Version 1.0 but will be massively upgraded  with new high resolution Lunar surface topography from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission (LRO had not yet launched when LE version 1.0 was built); it will have photorealistic 3D graphics detail and quality, very high resolution, and it will have many new added interactivity features.<br/><br/>
                                    We have put together a team of world class experts and partners to make Virtual Moon a reality. The team includes retired NASA Astronaut and MIT Professor Jeff Hoffman, former Disney Imagineeering VP, inventor and former NYU Professor Eric Rosenthal, Star Trek special effects producer Dan Curry, and “A Man On The Moon” author Andrew Chaikin, among other well-known leaders in the Space and Space Technology community.

                                    Development of the Virtual Moon simulation is being done by the multi-award- winning VR/AR company E-spaces,  – the world’s oldest continuously operating VR/AR studio founded and led by VR veteran Philippe Van Nedervelde. Philippe shares similar memories of being a witness to History during the Apollo years and an even bigger passion for Space and for the Moon than mine. Since his teenage years, he has accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments as a proponent of the vision of our Future in Space.<br/><br/>
                                    When we first made contact, we formed an immediate friendship about our shared passion for creating a direct, personal , and deeply inspiring experience of space for everyone. The decision to move forward as partners on Virtual Moon was instantaneous.
                                    Our entire team at Virtual Moon is excited to bring you this unique experience. Until you can physically go to the Moon, Virtual Moon will take you there virtually.
