                                    We are building Virtual Moon for you. Not just to explore and enjoy the experience of being on the Moon, but to be an active participant in its creation and even own a piece of Virtual Moon yourself.  We want to build a Virtual Moon community and want to offer every opportunity for you to be part of it and every opportunity to participate in the adventure of making it a reality.  Maybe you just want to stay up to date on our progress and special events by providing your name and getting on our email list. Or maybe you wish to get more involved and contribute ideas and feedback. We would like you to consider donating to Virtual Moon. What better way to be part of the adventure than being able to say that you helped to build it?  Your donation will help  fund the continued development of the most unique immersive experience of the Moon. In return, and in appreciation of your support, Virtual Moon will reserve 100 square meters of Virtual Moon property for each dollar donated. You will become a true stakeholder. You will own a piece of Virtual Moon for as little as $1.

                                When Virtual Moon is completed and officially launches (currently scheduled for 3rd quarter of 2022) users will be able to purchase and own Virtual Moon property.  At 1 cent per square meter, Virtual Moon property is amazingly affordable. A $1 investment will get you 100 square meters of property.

                                That’s a 10 meter by 10-meter square (about 33 feet by 33 feet). Once you have accumulated a large enough property, you will be able to develop it. You will be able to build your own structures, habitats, mining facilities, or anything else that you can imagine. We will post more details about this later on.

                                We could go the traditional route and look to Venture Capital firms to provide the funding for the full-scale development of Virtual Moon.  However, as already mentioned, we want to give our grassroots supporters every opportunity to participate in our success. We want you to be able to tell your friends that you helped to build Virtual Moon.<br/><br/>
                                We have set aside an undisclosed number of square kilometers of Virtual Moon property to give away as a direct incentive and as a way of expressing our gratitude for your support.

                                For every $10 donation you send us, we will reserve one square kilometer of VM property in your name.  Any amount you donate in multiples of $10 qualifies for the VMV promotion. If your donation is $40, for example, we will reserve 4 square kilometers. But you should hurry; once these limited parcels have all been given away, thee will be no more. When Virtual Moon is completed and opens to the public, your Ownership Options convert to actual property rights – You will own 1 square kilometer of Virtual Moon (1 million square meters) for each $10 donation.

                                The goal of the Lunar Archeology Project is to develop the most complete list of all man-made objects to be found on the surface of the Moon and to place every object at the exact location where it is.  When we say every object, we are talking not just about the objects that are currently intact such as the Apollo descent stages, all the instruments and tools left at the Apollo sites, the Surveyor landers, the Soviet and Chinese landers and rovers.

                                We believe this may very well be the most exciting of all possible adventures on Virtual Moon.<br/><br/>
                                Virtual Moon will be a Digital Twin of the Moon. An exact virtual replica rendered in fully immersive photorealistic detail and a fully simulated Lunar environment. It is being built as you read these words. It will be a permanent persistent environment that you can return to at any time. It has the exact same composition as the actual Moon in terms of the materials that can be found there and the same environmental properties (gravity, temperature profile, radiation, lunar dust, micrometeoroid impacts, etc). It requires that you overcome the same challenges of the Lunar environment. All the assets you need are at your disposal. The only limitations to contend with are the available technologies and the Laws of Physics.<br/><br/>
                                We are giving millions of you the opportunity to become extremely wealthy Virtual Moon land owners (See the Virtual Moon Visionary Initiative).

                                The visionaries among you will immediately see the possibilities. We are looking for a million Virtual Elon Musks. In Virtual Moon, you can have all the capabilities and resources to which Elon Musk has access and use them to build your dreams on the Moon.<br/><br/>
                                You have access to advanced technologies in robotics, Artificial Intelligence, materials, materials processing, manufacturing, and energy. But instead of having Mars as your goal, your objective is the Moon. You are singularly focused on building the first large scale permanent city on the Moon (Selene).<br/><br/>
                                With all these resources available to you, how would you do it?<br/><br/>
                                Is that a challenge you want to take on?
